# How to run the application onto your machine

To clone the files onto your machine start by creating an empty folder anywhere, once thats done go back to the code and press "code" and then switch it to "HTTPS" then copy the link:

once you have the link, open command prompt and type:

`git clone` + the link (add a space between clone and the link)

once you have it on your machine, open command prompt and change the directory to the folder it was saved in e.g:

then install the dependancies in command prompt using:

`npm install`

then start the program:

`npm run dev`

if it was sucessful something like this should come up:

then open the link next to Local on a browser and then you should be able to see the project

theres two inputs, one for name and one for the comment with a submit button and comments below its all savedf locally but when you upload a comment under a name it comes upo with the date it was posted and the time stamp.
